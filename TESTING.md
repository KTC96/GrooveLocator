# Testing

## Code validation

### HTML

I used [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

Because my project uses Jinja syntax, I copied source data from each page and validated by input.


| Page | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Home Logged Out  | ![Home](documentation/testing/home_logged_out.png)|Pass |
|Home Logged In  | ![Home](documentation/testing/home_logged_in.png)|Pass |
|Login | ![Login](documentation/testing/login_page.png)|Pass |
|Sign up|  ![Sign Up](documentation/testing/signup.png)|Fail(However this HTML code is part of the Django authentication form, and I could find no way to change it.) |
|Logout  | ![Logout](documentation/testing/signout_page.png)|Pass |
|Events Logged Out  | ![Events](documentation/testing/events_logged_out.png)|Pass |
|Events Logged In  | ![Events](documentation/testing/events_logged_in.png)|Pass |
|Saved Events | ![Events](documentation/testing/saved_events_logged_in.png)|Pass |
|Event Details Logged Out | ![Events](documentation/testing/event_details_logged_out.png)|Pass |
|Event Details Logged In | ![Events](documentation/testing/event_details_logged_in.png)|Pass |


### CSS

My CSS passed via direct input using the [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator). However it is important to note that when validating by URI, I receive errors relating to bootstrap CSS. I discussed this with my mentor and he assured me that this is not a problem.

    <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">
        <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
            src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss"
            alt="Valid CSS!">
    </a>

    <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
        src="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss-blue"
        alt="Valid CSS!">
    </a>
</p>
        
### Javascript

My current implementation combines JavaScript with Jinja and Django template language, which complicates the validation process. To enhance the structure for future iterations, I intend to separate my JavaScript code into dedicated files. Additionally, I plan to securely pass the Google Maps API key through a Django view.

Despite this, thorough inspection using Google Dev Tools in the browser console reveals no errors related to my JavaScript code.


### Python

I have used the [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate my Python files.

| File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| settings.py | ![settings](documentation/testing/settings.png) | Pass|
| models.py | ![models](documentation/testing/models.png) | Pass |
| urls.py (GrooveLocator) | ![urls](documentation/testing/main_urls.png) | Pass |
| urls.py (Map) | ![urls](documentation/testing/urls_map.png) | Pass |
| views.py (Map) | ![views](documentation/testing/views.png) | Pass |

## Bugs

The list of bugs can be found in my Git Hub project board.


### Fixed Bugs

| Bug | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| My CSS was not displaying when deployed on Heroku, with the error "Incorrect MIME type" | Changed DEBUG to False |
| The add event details expandable was stretching content when opened | Moved the button below other content to prevent this from occurring |
| Footer not sticking to the bottom of the page when there was not enough content to push it down  | Followed a Youtube tutorial and edited my css to ensure footer was always at the bottom  |
| The content within the sign up box was overflowing at smaller screen sizes | The max width was too narrow so content was spilling out vertically |
| Content did not fit within the google maps infowindows | I set minimum height to auto, prevented overflow from showing (as this was creating a scroll bar) and added padding to the elements inside. I also set up media queries so that content fit across screen sizes|
| The close button for the infowindow was too small and multiple infowindows could be opened at a time | I used dev tools to locate what code I had to change to increase the size, change the position and colour. I found code on the google developer website that allowed only one window to be open at a time |
| Add event details button was not centralized on the screen on mobile devices | Added the bootstrap class lg to the column which resolved the issue |


### Remaining Bugs

| Bug |
| --- |
| The events on the saved events page are not listed in date order  |
| The alerts do not auto-dismiss because they were giving me a console error so this functionality was removed |
| The input fields for login/ signup are too wide. This is so their associated headings are centralized. But I aim to fix this in the future |
